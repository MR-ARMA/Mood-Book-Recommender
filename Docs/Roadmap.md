### **Comprehensive Project Roadmap: Context-Aware Book Recommendation System**

**Project Title**: Context-Aware Book Recommendation System Based on User Personality and Emotion Prediction  
**Objective**: Develop a context-aware recommendation system that leverages natural language processing (NLP) to predict a user's personality traits and emotional states from textual input. Based on these predictions, the system will recommend books aligned with the user’s psychological profile.
